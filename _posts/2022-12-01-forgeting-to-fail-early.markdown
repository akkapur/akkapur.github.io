Perhaps bootstraping a startup, watching several y-combinator videos, and other past experiences may not be enough to help recognize patterns of a flailing project.

Working at larger organization(s), we tend to take certain aspects of building product for granted. 

For example, assuming engineering should only concern themselves with execution, leaving the customer validation and market analysis to the product teams.

I think we as engineers/leaders should try to approach medium to large scale projects like bootstraping a startup. When so much is going around you, it is easy to forget these lessons that echo every now and then - `to fail early` `validate with experiments`

My team recently had to pivot when we had invested good amount of effort and social capital. Even though we were agile, demo-able after each sprint, getting the project into user's hands looked far away.
